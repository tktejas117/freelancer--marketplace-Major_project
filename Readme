Installation & Setup

1. Clone the Repository

git clone [https://github.com/tktejas117/freelancer--marketplace-Major_project.git](https://github.com/tktejas117/freelancer--marketplace-Major_project.git)
cd freelancer--marketplace-Major_project


2. Install Server Dependencies
Navigate to the server folder and install its packages.

cd server
npm install


3. Install Client Dependencies
Navigate to the client folder and install its packages.

cd ../client
npm install


4. Create the Environment File
This is a critical step for connecting to the database.

In the server folder, create a new file named .env.

Open this file and add your MongoDB connection string, like this:

MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string_here


Running the Application

You must run both the server and the client in two separate terminals.

Terminal 1: Start the Server

# Make sure you are in the /server folder
npm start


Your server will be running on http://localhost:5000 (or as specified in your server code).

Terminal 2: Start the Client

# Make sure you are in the /client folder
npm start


The application will automatically open in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
